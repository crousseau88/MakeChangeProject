# MakeChangeProject

## Cash Register
 ## This is a cash register program which takes an item amount  	and amount of money tendered input by the user and gives 	back correct change if needed. 	This program is designed to 	only return the number of coins (Pennies, Nickels, Dimes, & 	Quarters) and notes (dollars, five dollar bills, ten dollar 	bills, and twenty dollar bills) needed to make the change.

## Technology Used
 ## Java 
 
 
##  How To Run
 ## Since this is just raw code, in order to run this program you will need to copy the code into an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or into a text editor 	such as Atom. Once you input the code into your preferred method, you can run it how you would any other code you write. Running this program will prompt you to enter the 	item cost followed by the amount tendered by the customer. The program will then give you the denominations needed in 	in order to make correct change. 

## What I Have Learned
 ## Writing this has taught me to be very careful of your symbol choices as well as your math. One incorrect > cost me an entire day of troubleshooting and then some. I also learned to use Math.round() in order to round up to the nearest value. This really helped me when issuing pennies back in the correct amount.
